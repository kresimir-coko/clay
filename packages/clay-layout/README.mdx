## Containers, Rows and Columns

These are the basic building blocks of any layout, we made Clay Layout very flexible with it's offerings of containers, rows and columns. All of these components allow for a custom HTML element to be used via the `containerElement` prop.

`Container` is a low-level component that serves as a wrapper of smaller building blocks like rows and columns. It is also used as a basis for a high-level variant `ContainerFluid` which is a `Container` without a fixed width.

`Row` and `Col` are self-explanatory, their purpose is to structure content inside them horizontally, or vertically. They are the next component in a typical DOM structure under a `Container`.

`Row` can be customized so that its `gutters` are removed, and its content can be `justified`.

`Col` (column) has various sizing options, from `xs` (extra small) to `xl` (extra large), as well as a `size` prop that allows custom sizing to be provided.

`ContentRow`, `ContentCol`, and `ContentSection` are small container components to be used as direct wrappers of your content. These elements are the lowest in the container structure while also serving layouting capabilities.
